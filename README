lab0.c: code for lab0 that copies stdin to stdout with other options such
as input/output files and causing segmentation faults

--input=filename  to use file as standard input
--output=filename to use the file as standard output
It will create the file if it is not there)

--segfault cause a segmentation faults
--catch use SIGSEGV handler to catch the segmentation fault and logging an error message

Makefile: 
default ... builds lab0 exec, 
check ... smoketest of lab0
clean ... deletes files created by the Makefile
dist ... builds a distribution tarball of files (including the screenshots .png)

screenshots:
backtrace.png... segementation fault and stack trace
breakpoint.png ... breakpoint and print

smoketests:
#1,2,3
Basic cases such as stdin to stdout
testing with valid input file and output file
Comparing if contents are the same
#4
Checks invalid option case. For example, --bogus as an option is used
#5
Checks nonwritable output file case by removing write permissions
#6
Checks for case where input file does not exist
#7
Segmentation fault case , when --segfault is used
#8
Catching segmentation fault case when both --segfault and --catch options are used
